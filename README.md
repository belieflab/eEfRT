# Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEFRT)
In this task participants must choose between completing the Hard Task or the Easy Task. 

**Easy Task:** Press the L key with your right index finger as fast as you can until the bar on the screen fills up.

**Hard Task:** Press the S key with your left pinky finger as fast as you can until the bar on the screen fills up.

The participant wins 100 points for completing the Easy Task and anywhere from 120-400 points for the hard task. However, completing the task alone will not guarantee points. Some trials have an 88% chance of winning points, some have a 50% chance of winning points, and some only have a 12% chance of winning points.

Participants are shown this information and are required to choose if they want to complete the easy or hard task. Participants will do this task for exactly 20 minutes. 

**Approx run time w/ practice: 25 minutes**
